### [C++](cpp/)
The [C++](cpp/) directory contains code exploring modern C++ features such as templates, lambdas, static polymorphism and more.

### [CUDA](cuda/)
The [CUDA](cuda/) directory contains CUDA tutorials and walkthroughs to familiarize myself with general purpose computing on NVIDIA GPUs. Exploring concepts such as Streaming Multiprocessors (SM), threads, blocks, grids, grid-stride loops, etc...

### [Leetcode](leetcode/)
The [Leetcode](leetcode/) folder is a collection of most of the Leetcode problems I have solved. The purpose is to become a DSA (data structures & algorithms) powerhouse, expanding my repertoire of tools to tackle any competitive programming challenges.

### [Python](python/)
[Python](python/) holds some of the scripts or object-oriented programs I've written in Python, mostly as a practice exercise.

### [GoLang](go/)
Nice programming language, but I'd much rather mismanage memory myself, thanks.
